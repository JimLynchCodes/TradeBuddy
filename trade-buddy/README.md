# TradeBuddy
The frontend Angular webapp piece of the overall Trade Buddy plaform.

## Pages
There are 3 core pages of trade buddy: Settings, Trade Bot, and News Feed.

### 1. Settings
This page allows you to connect a TD Ameritrade bot (kind of roundabout process for local dev, but it does work).
This is where the user can eit settings abut how the bot trades.
